Welcome to our PyTorch tutorial!

The goal of this tutorial is to give a quick overview of PyTorch to machine learning researchers. The target audience is people already accustomed with basic neural network theory and with some other neural networks like Keras+Tensorflow, Theano, Caffe and the like. We cover the basic PyTorch features that allows tinkering, tweaking and understanding alongside inference and training.

This repository is a companion for a ~1-2 hour long presentation. Two datasets are used, MNIST (vanilla from `torchvision`) and the [Kaggle's Dogs vs Cats Redux](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) dataset, with the folder hierarchy changed to fit [`torchvision`'s ImageFolder](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) hierarchy.

The proposed architectures are definitely *not* optimal for the given tasks, they are only presented for teaching purposes.

Requirements
------------

All the examples were developed for PyTorch 0.1 on Python 3.6 .
